h2. Ruby Build Monitor

Continuous Integration is a must all large projects, but what is more important is to get notified when the build has failed. With Ruby Build Monitor you can attach to various CI-servers and get notifications instantly. 

The idea is to be able to monitor every CI-server with an API for monitoring builds.
